# Code of Conduct Enforcement Guidelines

This document provides guidance for project maintainers on how to fairly and consistently enforce the Code of Conduct.

## General Principles

### Fairness and Consistency
- Apply the Code of Conduct consistently across all community members
- Consider the context and intent behind actions
- Focus on education and community healing when possible

### Proportional Response
- Match the enforcement action to the severity of the violation
- Consider the individual's history and standing in the community
- Escalate gradually when appropriate

### Transparency and Privacy
- Be transparent about the process while protecting individual privacy
- Document decisions for consistency and accountability
- Communicate clearly with all parties involved

## Enforcement Levels

### Level 1: Correction

- No public record

**Example situations**:

- Minor disruptions in discussions
- Misunderstandings about community norms

### Level 2: Warning
**Used for**: Repeated minor violations, moderate single violations

**Actions**:
- Formal written warning
- Clear explanation of the violation and expected behavior change
- Consequences spelled out for future violations
- May include temporary restrictions on participation

**Example situations**:
- Continued inappropriate behavior after correction
- Personal attacks or inflammatory comments
- Derailing important discussions

### Level 3: Temporary Ban
**Used for**: Serious violations, pattern of problematic behavior

**Actions**:
- Temporary ban from project spaces (1 week to 3 months)
- Public or private announcement (depending on severity)
- Clear conditions for reinstatement
- Monitoring period after return

**Example situations**:
- Harassment of community members
- Threats or intimidation
- Doxxing or sharing private information
- Repeated violations after warnings

### Level 4: Permanent Ban
**Used for**: Severe violations, threats to community safety

**Actions**:

- Public statement about the decision
- No possibility of reinstatement
- Report to relevant authorities if applicable

**Example situations**:
- Credible threats of violence
- Sexual harassment
- Stalking or persistent harassment
- Hate speech or discrimination

## Decision-Making Process

### Initial Assessment
1. **Gather Information**: Collect all relevant evidence and accounts
2. **Assess Severity**: Determine which enforcement level is appropriate
3. **Consider Context**: Look at the individual's history and circumstances
4. **Consult Team**: Discuss with other maintainers when appropriate

### Investigation Steps
1. **Document Everything**: Use the violation report template
2. **Interview Parties**: Speak with reporter, reported individual, and witnesses
3. **Review Evidence**: Examine all relevant communications and behavior
4. **Maintain Confidentiality**: Protect privacy throughout the process

### Making the Decision
1. **Team Consensus**: Aim for agreement among maintainers when possible
2. **Clear Rationale**: Document the reasoning behind the decision
3. **Consistent Application**: Ensure similar situations receive similar responses
4. **Review Process**: Allow for appeals and reconsideration

## Communication Guidelines

### With the Reported Individual
- Be clear and specific about what behavior violated the Code of Conduct
- Explain the consequences and what behavior changes are expected
- Provide opportunity for them to share their perspective
- Maintain professionalism even if they become defensive

### With the Reporter
- Thank them for bringing the issue to attention
- Explain the process and timeline
- Provide updates on resolution (while maintaining appropriate confidentiality)
- Ensure they feel supported throughout the process

### With the Community
- Provide general updates on Code of Conduct enforcement when appropriate
- Maintain individual privacy while being transparent about process
- Reinforce community values and expectations
- Address community concerns about fairness and consistency

## Special Considerations

### Repeat Offenders
- Maintain records of all enforcement actions
- Escalate more quickly for individuals with previous violations
- Consider permanent bans for patterns of problematic behavior

### Public vs. Private Violations
- Private violations may require private responses initially
- Public violations often need public acknowledgment
- Consider the impact on community trust and safety

### Cross-Platform Issues
- Consider behavior across all project-related spaces
- Coordinate with other platform moderators when relevant
- Document all relevant interactions

### Appeals Process
- Allow reasonable time for appeals (typically 30 days)
- Review decisions with fresh eyes
- Consider new evidence that may come to light
- Maintain final decision authority with maintainer team

## Resources and Support
